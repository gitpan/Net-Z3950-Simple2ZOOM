This directory contains auxiliary files that are not part of
Simple2ZOOM itself but which can be used to configure it, test
configurations, start and stop it, etc.

test.xml -- a sample Simple2ZOOM main configuration file, containing
	minimal definitions of many different targets, useful for
	development and testing.

nla.xml -- the beginnings of a main configuration file suitable for
	use by the National Library of Australia.

simple2zoom.rnc -- Relax-NG Compact schema constraining the
	main configuration file format.  (The format is described in
	prose in the Net::Z3950::Simple2ZOOM::Config manual.)

simple2zoom.rng, simple2zoom.xsd, simple2zoom.dtd -- automatically
	generated schemas constraining the main configuration file
	format using other constraint languages: Relax-NG XML, W3C
	Schema and DTD (Document Type Definition).

Makefile -- controls generation of the additional schemas from the
	Relax-NG Compact master schema, and checks that test.xml
	validates correctly.

yazgfs.xml -- A YAZ GFS (Generic Frontend Server) configuration file,
	as described at http://indexdata.com/yaz/doc/server.vhosts.tkl
	Its purpose is to use the file ccl-qualifiers.

ccl-qualifiers -- a simple set of CCL qualifiers indicating how
	Simple2ZOOM (actually the YAZ GFS) should translate them in
	the Type-1 attributes.  To enable CCL support, use the "-f
	yazgfs.xml" command-line option.

init-script -- a template for a startup/shutdown script that can be
	used as part of a System-V style init configuration
	(e.g. placed in the /etc/init.d directory of a Debian
	GNU/Linux installation).  This WILL NEED EDITING to allow for
	specific details of the installation.

sru-auth -- a trivial example of a mod_perl or CGI script that can
	perform Init authentication for Simple2ZOOM.
