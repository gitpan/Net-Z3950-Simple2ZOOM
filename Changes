Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::Simple2ZOOM.

1.03  Mon Apr 14 11:35:24 BST 2008
	Improvements to _format_grs1(), provided by Simon Jacob of the
	National Library of Australia <sjacob@nla.gov.au>:
	- The namespace prefix "x" is made available for GRS-1 record
	  configuration to refer to the top-level namespace.
	- Multiple occurrences of the same XML element are now
	  translated into separate occurrences of the corresponding
	  GRS-1 element rather than being concatenated into a single
	  value.
	Also:
	- Reporting of exception-handling is now requested by setting
	  the S2Z_EXCEPTION_DEBUG environment variable to 1 (or 2 for
	  extra verbosity).

1.02  Fri Nov 23 12:10:35 GMT 2007
	- Use the present handler to optimise situations in which the
	  client is requesting multiple records in a single bite:
	  previously, the server would be hit once for each record.

1.01  Wed Sep 26 13:18:47 BST 2007
	- Use Time::HiRes to instrument where time is spent.
	  Operation timings are emitted if the module-global $TIME is
	  set (so at present the only way to turn this on and off is
	  by tweaking the boolean in the source code).

1.00  Fri Sep 21 15:44:50 BST 2007
	- Add new "gsafd" database to test.xml.  This is an OCLC SRU
	  server that correctly implements result-set IDs and RSID
	  searching.
	- Otherwise identical to v0.94 (which was really the last of
	  the 1.0-prerelease versions).  With this version, the
	  software is ready for public release.

0.94  Fri Sep 14 15:42:48 BST 2007
	- Corrected handling of queries that include result-set
	  references.
	- Result-set reference handling is now configurable to use
	  either a corresponding result-set reference at the back end
	  or a re-executed query.
	- Documentation of the above.

0.93  Wed Sep 12 11:04:10 BST 2007
	- Correct handling of record-surrogate diagnostics provided by
	  ZOOM-C (when YAZ version 3.0.12 or better is available).

0.92  Mon Sep 10 18:43:59 BST 2007
	- Pass username/password tokens through into ZOOM-C.
	- Support for translating result-set IDs in Type-1 queries.
	- Initial searches do not fetch any records (presentChunk is
	  set to 0) so that subsequent records fetches, when the
	  client's fetch request has arrived and so the required
	  schema is known, do not get bad cache-hits.
	- Request MARCXML schema if client wants USMARC records.
	- Correct handling of completeness attributes.
	- Handle BIB-1 relation attributes.
	- Correctly generate and recognise cql.resultSetId for
	  result-set references, rather than cql.resultSet as before.
	- Detect, parse, translate and report surrogate diagnostic
	  records.
	- Configurable schema handling: each database may nominate a
	  set of Z39.50 schema OIDs which, if requested, cause a
	  particular SRU schema to be requested from the back-end, and
	  the resulting records translated into the appropriate MARC
	  format.  NOTE that in its current form this only works for
	  the specific though common combination of Z39.50 front-end,
	  SRU back-end and MARC record syntax.

0.91  Sat Sep  1 10:38:21 BST 2007
	- Support for CCL queries added to the YAZ GFS, therefore to
	  SimpleServer, therefore to Simple2ZOOM.  Requires YAZ
	  version 3.0.9 or later.
	- Added new files to etc directory to configure CCL support:
	  yazgfs.xml is a YAZ GFS configuration file, and
	  ccl-qualifiers maps qualifiers to BIB-1 attributes.
	- Support for the Scan service.
	- Support translation of truncation attributes 101 (process #
	  in search term) and 104 (Z39.58) into CQL.  (Only partial in
	  the latter case since CQL wildcards have no equivalent of
	  /ana?4titan/.)
	- Support for the Delete Result Set service -- sort of.  Since
	  SRU in fact has no analogous service, all the gateway can do
	  is accept Delete requests and quietly no-op.
	- Configurable HTTP-based authentication.
	- Add a trivial sample authenticator script, etc/sru-auth
	- Add etc/README to describe the increasing number of files in
	  that directory.
	- Support for the Sort service, subject to several provisos,
	  the most important being that due to limitations in ZOOM-C
	  (as of YAZ 3.0.10), sorting no-ops against SRU 1.1
	  back-ends.  It works correctly against both Z39.50 and SRU
	  1.2 back-ends.
	- Support for the SUTRS record syntax.
	- Support for the MARC record syntax.
	- Simple support for the GRS-1 record syntax.

0.90  Fri Aug 10 23:26:00 BST 2007
      (INITIAL RELEASE of 10th August 2007 -- 1.0 pre-release)
	  Basic Z39.50/SRU Gateway implementing connection management
	  and the Init, Search and Present services, including Type-1
	  to CQL query translation, and XML to Z39.50 response record
	  translation.  NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RELEASE although is was
	  scheduled to be: handling CCL queries by translation into
	  CQL.

0.10  Fri Jul  6 16:59:47 BST 2007
	- Functionally equivalent to the old code, but now packaged in
	  a CPAN-friendly way.  Version number bumped to 0.10 in this
	  initial "null release" to match the version number 0.1 in
	  the pre-framework code, which has been distributed to some
	  customers, since the functionality is identical.

0.01  Fri Jul  6 16:12:13 2007
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X --name=Net::Z3950::Simple2ZOOM --compat-version=5.8.0 --omit-constant --skip-exporter --skip-ppport

	  (The core code is rather older than this, and goes back at
	  least to Seb's CVS revision 1.1 of the main script, checked
	  in on 31st March 2006.  The date above marks the first
	  version to be Perl-module packaged, as a step towards making
	  a public release.)
